Implementation of multi touch gestures using native APIs.

## Local development

Make sure you have npm with npx installed and run:

```bash
npm install
npx http-server -c-1  # disable caching
```

Additionally, it may be useful to download [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/). It can be used to proxy the local dev server to a public IP temporarily, making testing the with different mobile devices easier.

```bash
./ngrok http 8080
```
